# Bookify
The 2016 Apprenticeship exam Bookify project.

## Introduction

Bookify is an online book library and shop, that lets members buy and borrow epub books, and read them either online, or via the smarphone app,

## What is this?

This is the final result of the apprenticeship exam that started on EUC Syd Sønderborg, on the 4th of August 2016.
The general idea was to make a service that allows users to buy and borrow books online, and for publishers to upload their own books as they get published.
